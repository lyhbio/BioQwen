"Hello doctor,I have a query on ectopic pregnancy. My wife is having one and her beta hCG levels were 125.25 ml after taking her first shot of Methotrexate. Yesterday, she got her second shot and her beta hCG levels today were 141. I wanted to know how much time Methotrexate takes to low down those levels and I was wondering if we were a little hurried in taking the second dose so quickly.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I hope you had taken the Methotrexate dose under supervision only. The usual protocol is to check for a repeat beta hCG on the fourth day of taking Methotrexate. Early testing may cause undue anxiety and panic as it takes some time for the levels to come down. Moreover, a few times the levels get slightly elevated after a Methotrexate. So stay calm and follow the instructions of the gynecologist you are following. Just report to the emergency in case of any acute pain, giddiness or bleeding.","I have gone through your query. I would like to know a few more details. Is she having any other medical illness? Is she taking any other medications? Is she having any bleeding? If she is having any bleeding, is it like a period or is it like a miscarriage?"

"Hello doctor,Kindly shed light on some issues. I had my period two months back and I had the next once a month later, which only came for a day and I have not had it since it till now.

"Hello doctor, I am a 48 years old male. A couple of months ago, I was diagnosed with a bulging disc in C6 and C7. I had pain and weakness associated with such a problem, and after some treatment, the pain subsided. Since then, my left index finger developed a twitch. Always at rest and occasionally twitching on and off most of the day. Some days I would hardly notice it at all if any. Now my left middle finger is starting to twitch the same as my index finger, and I do not notice the twitch in my index finger as I did before. And I also noticed an occasional toe twitch on either foot before falling asleep at night. I could blame the finger twitching on the, disc, but the toes on each foot make me concerned. I am concerned about Parkinson\\s disease. I researched all I could online. I do not have any of the other symptoms associated with the disease.

"Hello doctor,I am a 40-year-old dental surgeon with no past or present health issues and I am trying to conceive. I have a regular cycle of 28 days and I have consulted a gynaecologist before who has put me on Clomid for three months. I have also taken all the required fertility tests which show normal values that are needed for conceiving. This cycle I had all the pregnancy symptoms like implantation spotting for two days, tender breasts and lower abdominal mild cramps for a week after spotting. However, I have got a negative urine and blood test, blood hCG level being 1.2 mIU/mL. On the first day of the last period, there was spotting and light bleeding was seen for three to four days. I tested for blood hCG after seven days and it showed <1.2 mIU/mL. I want to know if there is still a chance that I could be pregnant and retest myself after a few days?","Hello. As your serum beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) result is also negative it definitely indicates you have not got pregnant in this cycle. The symptoms you have mentioned could also be possible because of the progesterone hormone secretion in the postovulatory phase which may mimic pregnancy and the spotting could be due to the breakthrough bleed. A possibility of delayed conception can be taken into consideration but because the serum beta hCG is negative it is ruled out. I would suggest you get your day two LH (luteinizing hormone), FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), prolactin, TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels, fasting blood sugar and postprandial blood sugar levels, and serum AMH (anti-Mullerian hormone) levels and an HSG (hysterosalpingography) done and let me know the results.

"Hello doctor,I have been feeling some pain in my lower left abdomen for past three months. The pain is not intense though, and it does not disrupt my daily activities, though it comes for a few minutes and then goes. I did an utrasound scan, no stone was found, the radiologists said it might be a muscular pain as all the organs examined through the abdominal scan were fine. I did urine analysis (sample was taken after sweating from the heat of the sun), the result says crystals of calcium oxalate (+) was found. I took Buscopan, Amoxicillin and Ciprofloxacin. I need your expert opinion on this.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Relax and do not worry. Yes, it is possible that you may have a stone in the urinary system. Sometimes, stones get missed on ultrasound examination. I suggest you get plain CT scan (without contrast) of abdomen and pelvis region. It will 100 percent rule out the stone in the urinary system. If no stone in CT scan is there, then your pain is musculoskeletal origin. For more information consult a urologist online","I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The ultrasound scan is normal. The urine analysis is also normal.

"Hi doctor,I am a 31 year old unmarried male. Over the last few months my sperm looks watery whenever I ejaculate. Will it create any problem? Also my erection is not like earlier. Kindly advise me doctor.","Hi. I have read and understood your problem. The fluid that male organ secrete during ejaculation is called semen. Semen is a visible liquid. It contains millions of invisible microscopic male counterpart of female eggs called sperms. It does not matter if your semen is more watery, the sperm count in semen should be normal and that can be detected by semen analysis, which is done at a pathology laboratory. Erection problem appears to be due to stress or anxiety. So, do relaxation exercise. However, to exclude other cause you need to do some blood tests like sugar and hormones. Stop smoking if you smoke. Check your BP (blood pressure). If you are taking any medicine or nutritional supplement on regular basis then it may be due to side effect of that.

"Hello doctor,I am 17 years old. I had sex with my partner on the 24th day of the menustruation cycle. I used Today vaginal pill before intercourse. On the next day i.e. 25th day, within 30 hours, I also took i-pill to be sure not to be pregnant. Now my period which was on due is still missing. What are the chances of my pregnancy? What should I do to terminate it, if I am pregnant? Kindly help me out.","Hello. I have reviewed your query thoroughly. I-pill or emergency contraceptive pills have very minimal chance of failure if taken immediately after intercourse within 24 hours and chances of failure gradually increase after that even if taken within 72 hours. There is about one to two percent chance of failure of an emergency pill or i-pill in your case. But we can be quite sure of its success if with ChatDoctor.  Based on the dates given by you, today must be 8 days following the date of the intercourse. In that case, to find out if you are pregnant, you can get a serum beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) testing done. For the urine pregnancy tests to show the result if pregnant, it must be at least 10 to 14 days following intercourse. If you want to know urgently whether you are pregnant, you can get serum beta hCG testing. If you can wait another week, you can get a urine pregnancy testing, which if positive must be followed up by ultrasound imaging. Only after then and after consulting an obstetrician, should the abortion be planned under guidance. Furthermore, if you are sexually active regularly, it is better to choose other regular contraceptive methods after consulting an obstetrician and gynecologist instead of i-pill. I-pills are meant to be taken only in case of unexpected accidental unprotected sex, but not on a regular basis.","I have gone through your query. The chances of pregnancy are very less as you have taken the i-pill within 72 hours of intercourse. So, there is no chance of pregnancy. The delay in periods could be due to hormonal imbalance. You can wait for 10 days and if periods do not start, then you can opt for urine pregnancy test. If it is negative, then you can opt for hormonal pills."
"Hello doctor,My mom had cough and cold which continued for a week. We conducted X-ray which indicated too much cough congestion in the chest and TLC count was 18K. One day, due to too much cough she vomited, and she was injected with a medicine to stop it and it worked. Next day, we went abroad for a week and as soon as we came back, we reconducted the X-ray which still indicates congestion is there and TLC count is now 15K. But she is getting fever since two days reaching up to 103. Crocin is not reducing it. I am really worried. Is it a viral fever? Or is it because of congestion. I am attaching the prescription/ medicines which she is taking as well as the latest blood report.","Hello. It is not a viral infection but a bacterial infection as her TLC has increased. Also, diabetic patients are prone to such infection. Treatment is antibiotics, which she has been started by her physician. In most patients, this resolves with a week. Continue other medicines as prescribed. We should see a response in 24 to 48 hours. If there is no improvement in fever, cough, or increase in her symptoms like increased shortness of breath, visit a hospital as her antibiotics will need to be escalated and she may need higher IV antibiotics. If you have electronic BP apparatus, then monitor BP twice a day. Excessive fall in BP or decreased frequency of urination are some of the warning signs. Repeat TLC, urea and creatinine test to see antibiotics response. So overall, a majority of the patients recover well but some amount of risk is always there in such infections. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.  Take care.","I have gone through the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The X-ray is suggestive of pneumonia. The fever is due to the same. The TLC (total leukocyte count) is high, but it is not alarming. The CBC (complete blood count) is also normal. The antibiotics are not working.

"Hello doctor,I am 20 years old. Two to three months ago, I started to have pain on my left testicle whenever I go out as I am usually at home. I speculate that I have varicocele as upon doing a self-examination, I found that the veins were bigger than the other testicle. There were no lumps found, but the left testicle feels bigger than the right one.I would say it is around 5 mm bigger in diameter. I do not have urinary problems like burning sensation. Although when it pains, my left lower abdomen and the pelvic area also hurt sometimes which could be due to lack of exercise as I am on my computer most of the time.The pain or ache on my left testicle usually appears when I am wearing tight pants. But I did not have this problem three months ago. I consulted a general practitioner, and he did a physical check and said it was likely due to congestion of the blood at the testicle. Do you think it could be an infection like epididymitis? I only had sex once in my life with my partner, but I do not have any other symptoms of STD. And do you think that there is something serious? Or is it probably due to congestion or tight pants?","Hello. Testicular pain with no obvious pathology on physical examination is common in young boys. As the testes descend through the lower abdominal wall, they carry spiral muscle which keeps them suspended in a dynamic position. Contraction of these muscles gives rise to pain. Tight pants press on the inguinal canal and may hinder venous return causing congestion. Wearing Langot (cotton strip worn by wrestlers to support testicles in India) will prevent their hanging, so there will be no muscle contraction. Get a USG scrotum (ultrasound). Wear scrotal support (langot). Kindly consult your doctor to discuss the suggestion and take the treatment with concern. Tablet Pregabalin 75 mg with Mecobalamin (Methylcobalamin) at bedtime for 10 days.","I have gone through your query and the attached pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I can see the varicocele, but it is not very significant. The pain is not due to the varicocele. It is due to the tight pants. The testicular pain is due to the epididymitis.

I have gone through your lab reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and they are consistent with the diagnosis made by your doctor.Yellowish tint of the eyes is due to increased bilirubin levels. This is due to the increased red blood cell destruction in the spleen and is commonly a complication of hereditary spherocytosis. It is understandable that you are feeling weak since your body is producing red blood cells at an accelerated rate to compensate for the destruction occurring in the spleen. This is also the reason why your spleen is enlarged. If your condition worsens, your doctor might suggest a splenectomy. This will not cure the condition but will relieve the symptoms since the site of destruction of red blood cells will be removed and your red blood cells will be able to survive for a longer period in the blood. Splenectomy, however, can predispose one to certain bacterial infections and it is important that you receive the appropriate vaccines regularly.

I read carefully your question and would explain that your symptoms could be related to chronic lesions of multiple sclerosis MS (sometimes there is no total improvement after steroid therapy). Anyway, I would recommend starting Gabapentin for chronic pain or switch from Zoloft to Duloxetine which is better for chronic pain. I would also recommend performing a new brain and spine MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in order to exclude possible new lesions. It is also necessary to check thyroid hormone levels for possible hormonal imbalance and vitamin D plasma levels for possible deficiency. I hope this helps.  Take care.","I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have multiple sclerosis (MS). I would suggest you to take tablet Pregabalin 75 mg at night for 10 days. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent.

"Hello doctor,The tooth is sharp and cracked. It is leaving a space in the mouth. What is the treatment?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. How are you doing? I saw the image, but it is not clear (attachment removed to protect patient identity). But, based on how much ever I could appreciate, it seems you have deep caries in your first molar and to some extent nearby second premolar too. The crack or sharpness is due to the loss of tooth structure because of caries (cavity). Kindly take an IOPA (intraoral periapical radiograph) of both the teeth together (in one X-ray itself) and send it to me, along with a clear image of your teeth to help you with a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Do you have or had pain, especially during chewing or sleeping? The treatment plan will vary based on the diagnosis. If the cavity has reached the pulp (blood supply of tooth), it will need a root canal treatment followed by a crown. If it is approximating the pulp, then we will give a temporary filling, wait for a month and if there are no symptoms, then we will change it to a permanent filling (restoration). If it is not even approximating pulp and is in dentin or just enamel (hard structures of teeth), then we will straight away go for permanent restoration (tooth filling). All these will eventually treat your cavity and the sharpness and the gap will go away. Kindly send me a clear picture and the radiograph to help you precisely. Take care.

So he did not have any symptoms, and this was detected on routine blood testing, right? His troponin is elevated here (attachment removed to protect patient identity), so it suggests he had a heart attack. So such patients are admitted for observation and administration of medications. We usually recommend admission immediately after a heart attack for 5 to 7 days, but since this time has already passed, admission is not absolutely necessary, but better to get admitted for observation, injectionClexane, and angiography. He should undergo echo and angiography, and for angiography, he has to be admitted. After angiography, he may need angioplasty or bypass. Also, if any warning signs like low bp or shortness of breath are there then he should be admitted.  Also, Clexane is blood thinner which helps in the dissolution of an already formed clot which is the reason for heart attack. So it should be given after heart attack.
