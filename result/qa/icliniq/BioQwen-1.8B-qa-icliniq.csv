"Hi doctor,I am suffering from irregular periods. I am currently taking medication Levothyroxine 50. My T3 is 0.87 ng/mL, T4 is 8.30 ug/dL, TSH is 2.43 uIU/mL. I am 34 years old, weigh 75 kg, and 5 feet tall. Please advice.","Hi. From your query, I understand that you are suffering from hypothyroidism. I need to know when was it diagnosed, and what was the thyroid profile at that time. Irregular periods and weight gain is a part of hypothyroidism. I would like to modify your dose as well as advise you ways to reduce your weight. All will be well once we modify your dose.","Hello, I have reviewed your medical history and current medication regimen. You are taking Levothyroxine, which is a synthetic thyroxine hormone that regulates thyroid hormone levels. Your T3 and T4 levels are within the normal range, but your TSH level is slightly elevated. This is a common side effect of Levothyroxine, and it can sometimes lead to hypothyroidism. Your TSH level is also slightly elevated, which can be due to other factors such as stress or hypothyroidism. I recommend that you have a thyroid function test to determine if you have hypothyroidism. If your TSH level is still elevated, you may need to adjust your medication dose or consider a different medication. Additionally, your weight and height may also affect your thyroid hormone levels. It is important to maintain a healthy weight and a balanced diet to support your thyroid function. I recommend that you consult with your doctor to discuss your medication regimen and any potential changes you may need to make."
"Hello doctor,I have a query on ectopic pregnancy. My wife is having one and her beta hCG levels were 125.25 ml after taking her first shot of Methotrexate. Yesterday, she got her second shot and her beta hCG levels today were 141. I wanted to know how much time Methotrexate takes to low down those levels and I was wondering if we were a little hurried in taking the second dose so quickly.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I hope you had taken the Methotrexate dose under supervision only. The usual protocol is to check for a repeat beta hCG on the fourth day of taking Methotrexate. Early testing may cause undue anxiety and panic as it takes some time for the levels to come down. Moreover, a few times the levels get slightly elevated after a Methotrexate. So stay calm and follow the instructions of the gynecologist you are following. Just report to the emergency in case of any acute pain, giddiness or bleeding.","Hello, I understand your concern. Methotrexate is a medication used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. It works by reducing the production of adenosine deaminase, which is responsible for the production of adenosine. Adenosine is a hormone that is produced in the liver and is responsible for the production of cytokines, which are proteins that are involved in the immune response. Methotrexate can reduce the production of cytokines, which can lead to a decrease in the production of adenosine. However, it is important to note that Methotrexate can also have a short-term effect on the levels of adenosine and cytokines in the body. Therefore, it is recommended to take Methotrexate at regular intervals to maintain the desired levels of adenosine and cytokines. Regarding your question about the timing of taking the second dose, it is recommended to take Methotrexate at regular intervals to maintain the desired levels of adenosine and cytokines. However, it is important to note that the timing of the second dose may vary depending on the individual needs of the patient. It is recommended to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate timing and dosage of Methotrexate. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me."

Having seen your PCOS reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it is suggested that you should opt for controlled ovarian stimulation and intrauterine insemination procedure.","Hello, thank you for your question. I understand your concern. Based on your symptoms and medical history, it appears that you are having a hormonal imbalance that is causing your symptoms. However, it is not clear whether your periods are regular or irregular. It is also not clear whether you are ovulating or not. I suggest that you undergo a complete hormonal evaluation to determine whether your symptoms are due to hormonal imbalance or other causes. In the meantime, I recommend that you take Metformin 500 mg thrice daily for five months. This will help to regulate your insulin levels and improve your hormonal balance. You should also take Oxetol 300 mg twice daily for partial seizure. This medication will help to regulate your seizures. In addition, you should take Clomid 50 mg once daily for 21 days. This will help to regulate your ovulation and improve your chances of pregnancy. I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns."

"Hello doctor,I fear I may have contracted HIV. A month back, I had oral sex and regular sex from an unknown girl. Three days later, I started to feel very sick, headache, cold in warm weather, tired, diarrhea, sweating in bed (I thought this could be food poisoning). A week later I felt better but had breakouts on my whole back (thought maybe from sweating in bed and training in severe heat the past week).

"Hello doctor,I am a 40-year-old dental surgeon with no past or present health issues and I am trying to conceive. I have a regular cycle of 28 days and I have consulted a gynaecologist before who has put me on Clomid for three months. I have also taken all the required fertility tests which show normal values that are needed for conceiving. This cycle I had all the pregnancy symptoms like implantation spotting for two days, tender breasts and lower abdominal mild cramps for a week after spotting. However, I have got a negative urine and blood test, blood hCG level being 1.2 mIU/mL. On the first day of the last period, there was spotting and light bleeding was seen for three to four days. I tested for blood hCG after seven days and it showed <1.2 mIU/mL. I want to know if there is still a chance that I could be pregnant and retest myself after a few days?","Hello. As your serum beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) result is also negative it definitely indicates you have not got pregnant in this cycle. The symptoms you have mentioned could also be possible because of the progesterone hormone secretion in the postovulatory phase which may mimic pregnancy and the spotting could be due to the breakthrough bleed. A possibility of delayed conception can be taken into consideration but because the serum beta hCG is negative it is ruled out. I would suggest you get your day two LH (luteinizing hormone), FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), prolactin, TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels, fasting blood sugar and postprandial blood sugar levels, and serum AMH (anti-Mullerian hormone) levels and an HSG (hysterosalpingography) done and let me know the results.

The hCG level is <1.2 mIU/mL, which is below the normal range for pregnancy. It is recommended that you wait for a few days and repeat the hCG test to confirm the pregnancy. If the hCG level remains negative, you can consider taking a break from Clomid and wait for a few days to see if the hCG level increases. If the hCG level remains negative, you can consider taking another course of Clomid to see if the pregnancy develops. If the hCG level increases, you can consider trying to conceive again.

In some cases, the condition may be managed successfully and the child may survive without any complications. In other cases, the condition may be severe and may require lifelong management. In my opinion, I would recommend that your sister-in-law consult with a fetal urologist or a fetal nephrologist who can perform a thorough evaluation of the condition and provide a detailed prognosis. They can also discuss the risks and benefits of surgery and other treatment options. They can also provide you with information about the likelihood of complications and the likelihood of survival. I hope this information is helpful."
"Hello doctor,I have been feeling some pain in my lower left abdomen for past three months. The pain is not intense though, and it does not disrupt my daily activities, though it comes for a few minutes and then goes. I did an utrasound scan, no stone was found, the radiologists said it might be a muscular pain as all the organs examined through the abdominal scan were fine. I did urine analysis (sample was taken after sweating from the heat of the sun), the result says crystals of calcium oxalate (+) was found. I took Buscopan, Amoxicillin and Ciprofloxacin. I need your expert opinion on this.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Relax and do not worry. Yes, it is possible that you may have a stone in the urinary system. Sometimes, stones get missed on ultrasound examination. I suggest you get plain CT scan (without contrast) of abdomen and pelvis region. It will 100 percent rule out the stone in the urinary system. If no stone in CT scan is there, then your pain is musculoskeletal origin. For more information consult a urologist online","Hello, Based on the symptoms and test results you provided, your symptoms may be related to the urinary system. The urinalysis results show the presence of calcium ions in your urine, which could be a cause of stones. It is recommended that you undergo another urinalysis and ultrasound examination to determine if there are any stones. Additionally, you mentioned that your pain might be related to muscles, which could also be a cause of the pain. It is advisable to consult your doctor to determine if further examination and treatment are necessary. In the meantime, you can try some methods to relieve muscle pain, such as applying heat, massage, and getting adequate rest. Please maintain good dietary habits and a healthy lifestyle to help alleviate the symptoms."
"Hi doctor,A few days back, a brown spot appeared halfway on my thigh. By the same night, it grew and it was black. In less than 24 hours. Small brown spot turned black and grew in just a few hours. It is flat. I am writing this a week later. The edges are flaky now. It has a slightly rough texture but the edges are peeling in not picking it. Do you think it could be melanoma? I am brown in complexion but had an aunt who died of skin cancer.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. The bigger brown patch is cafe-au-lait macule and the small one is probably an atypical nevus (attachment removed to protect patient identity). That is not melanoma clinically to me. Melanoma is very rare at a young age like in your case and obviously very rare in brown skin color.

"Hi doctor,I have a problem to defecate completely. It takes me more than 20 minutes to defecate completely. I also take more than two minutes to pass urine completely. I am very healthy. I consulted a doctor, and I have done various tests and examinations such as defecogram, balloon expulsion test, rectal manometry, and colonoscopy.

"Hi doctor,I am a 31 year old unmarried male. Over the last few months my sperm looks watery whenever I ejaculate. Will it create any problem? Also my erection is not like earlier. Kindly advise me doctor.","Hi. I have read and understood your problem. The fluid that male organ secrete during ejaculation is called semen. Semen is a visible liquid. It contains millions of invisible microscopic male counterpart of female eggs called sperms. It does not matter if your semen is more watery, the sperm count in semen should be normal and that can be detected by semen analysis, which is done at a pathology laboratory. Erection problem appears to be due to stress or anxiety. So, do relaxation exercise. However, to exclude other cause you need to do some blood tests like sugar and hormones. Stop smoking if you smoke. Check your BP (blood pressure). If you are taking any medicine or nutritional supplement on regular basis then it may be due to side effect of that.

"Hello doctor,I am 17 years old. I had sex with my partner on the 24th day of the menustruation cycle. I used Today vaginal pill before intercourse. On the next day i.e. 25th day, within 30 hours, I also took i-pill to be sure not to be pregnant. Now my period which was on due is still missing. What are the chances of my pregnancy? What should I do to terminate it, if I am pregnant? Kindly help me out.","Hello. I have reviewed your query thoroughly. I-pill or emergency contraceptive pills have very minimal chance of failure if taken immediately after intercourse within 24 hours and chances of failure gradually increase after that even if taken within 72 hours. There is about one to two percent chance of failure of an emergency pill or i-pill in your case. But we can be quite sure of its success if with ChatDoctor.  Based on the dates given by you, today must be 8 days following the date of the intercourse. In that case, to find out if you are pregnant, you can get a serum beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) testing done. For the urine pregnancy tests to show the result if pregnant, it must be at least 10 to 14 days following intercourse. If you want to know urgently whether you are pregnant, you can get serum beta hCG testing. If you can wait another week, you can get a urine pregnancy testing, which if positive must be followed up by ultrasound imaging. Only after then and after consulting an obstetrician, should the abortion be planned under guidance. Furthermore, if you are sexually active regularly, it is better to choose other regular contraceptive methods after consulting an obstetrician and gynecologist instead of i-pill. I-pills are meant to be taken only in case of unexpected accidental unprotected sex, but not on a regular basis.","Hello, I understand your concern. The chances of pregnancy are higher if the intercourse occurred on the 24th day of the menstrual cycle. However, taking the Today vaginal pill before intercourse can help prevent pregnancy. The i-pill you took on the 25th day can also help to prevent pregnancy. If your period is still missing, it is possible that you may be pregnant. In this case, you should consult a healthcare professional for advice on the best course of action. If you are pregnant, there are options available for termination of pregnancy. You should discuss with your healthcare professional about the options available to you. They will advise you on the best course of action based on your medical condition and circumstances.

"Hello doctor,My mom had cough and cold which continued for a week. We conducted X-ray which indicated too much cough congestion in the chest and TLC count was 18K. One day, due to too much cough she vomited, and she was injected with a medicine to stop it and it worked. Next day, we went abroad for a week and as soon as we came back, we reconducted the X-ray which still indicates congestion is there and TLC count is now 15K. But she is getting fever since two days reaching up to 103. Crocin is not reducing it. I am really worried. Is it a viral fever? Or is it because of congestion. I am attaching the prescription/ medicines which she is taking as well as the latest blood report.","Hello. It is not a viral infection but a bacterial infection as her TLC has increased. Also, diabetic patients are prone to such infection. Treatment is antibiotics, which she has been started by her physician. In most patients, this resolves with a week. Continue other medicines as prescribed. We should see a response in 24 to 48 hours. If there is no improvement in fever, cough, or increase in her symptoms like increased shortness of breath, visit a hospital as her antibiotics will need to be escalated and she may need higher IV antibiotics. If you have electronic BP apparatus, then monitor BP twice a day. Excessive fall in BP or decreased frequency of urination are some of the warning signs. Repeat TLC, urea and creatinine test to see antibiotics response. So overall, a majority of the patients recover well but some amount of risk is always there in such infections.

She is now experiencing fever, reaching up to 103 degrees Celsius, and her Crocin is not reducing. The blood report also shows that the TLC count is high.

"Hello doctor,I am 20 years old. Two to three months ago, I started to have pain on my left testicle whenever I go out as I am usually at home. I speculate that I have varicocele as upon doing a self-examination, I found that the veins were bigger than the other testicle. There were no lumps found, but the left testicle feels bigger than the right one.I would say it is around 5 mm bigger in diameter. I do not have urinary problems like burning sensation. Although when it pains, my left lower abdomen and the pelvic area also hurt sometimes which could be due to lack of exercise as I am on my computer most of the time.The pain or ache on my left testicle usually appears when I am wearing tight pants. But I did not have this problem three months ago. I consulted a general practitioner, and he did a physical check and said it was likely due to congestion of the blood at the testicle. Do you think it could be an infection like epididymitis? I only had sex once in my life with my partner, but I do not have any other symptoms of STD. And do you think that there is something serious? Or is it probably due to congestion or tight pants?","Hello. Testicular pain with no obvious pathology on physical examination is common in young boys. As the testes descend through the lower abdominal wall, they carry spiral muscle which keeps them suspended in a dynamic position. Contraction of these muscles gives rise to pain. Tight pants press on the inguinal canal and may hinder venous return causing congestion. Wearing Langot (cotton strip worn by wrestlers to support testicles in India) will prevent their hanging, so there will be no muscle contraction. Get a USG scrotum (ultrasound). Wear scrotal support (langot). Kindly consult your doctor to discuss the suggestion and take the treatment with concern. Tablet Pregabalin 75 mg with Mecobalamin (Methylcobalamin) at bedtime for 10 days.","Hello, thank you for your question. Based on your symptoms, it seems that you may have a varicocele. However, it is unlikely that this is the cause of your pain on your left testicle. The pain may be due to other causes such as tight pants or congestion. It is also possible that the pain may be due to an infection, but this would need to be ruled out. In the meantime, you can try to wear loose-fitting pants and avoid tight clothing. If the pain persists or worsens, you may need to consult a doctor for further evaluation."

"Hi doctor,I am 24 years old. I have stiffness and pain in thighs and knees for more than a year. I cannot sit properly and stand up instantly. I am having problem in each and every activity involving legs. I have reduced mobility and flexibility of legs. My report shows AVN stage 3 of hip joint, for which I have been suggested hip replacement surgery. My question is that, if problem is in hip joint then why I have so many problems with knees?

I am worried whether I have some other problem in knees also.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Hip avascular necrosis (AVN) and hip arthritis causes pain in the affected hip and also sometimes in the knees as the same nerve which supplies the hip also supplies the knee joint. It is called as obturator nerve. This nerve supplies both the joints. So if there is hip joint pain, many patients also get pain in the knee joint. But, also to be sure if nothing is wrong with the knee joint, you should take x-rays and document it. Get x-ray of the knee joint both in anteroposterior view (AP) and lateral view and then get a follow up done to confirm your problem.","Hello, thank you for your question. It is important to understand that AVN is a condition that affects the bones and joints in the lower extremities, and it can be caused by a number of factors, including aging, trauma, and lifestyle habits. While hip replacement surgery may be recommended in cases of hip arthritis, it is not always necessary, and there are other treatment options available. Regarding your knee pain, it is possible that the pain is due to AVN in the hip joint, but it is also possible that it is due to other factors, such as osteoarthritis or bony abnormalities. In order to determine the cause of your knee pain, it is important to have a thorough examination of your knee joint and surrounding tissues. This may include a physical examination, X-rays, and/or MRI scans. Based on the results of this examination, your doctor can recommend the appropriate treatment options, including physical therapy, medication, or surgery if necessary. In the meantime, it is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle and avoid any activities that may exacerbate your knee pain, such as prolonged standing or walking on uneven surfaces. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to contact your doctor or seek additional medical advice."
"Hello doctor,I am having an inguinal mesh removal and triple neurectomy 20 days later. What type of pain and side effects should I expect from the neurectomy?","Hello. I understand your concern and would explain that this type of neurectomy is usually used to treat chronic resistant pain in the groin area (inguinal region) due to inguinal herniation. So, it is supposed that your situation will improve, and you will experience only local pain due to the surgery and soft tissues inflammation. This type of pain will usually disappear in a couple of weeks, after healing. Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen can help improve pain. If neurectomy is not successful, persistent pain like heaviness or dull pain may persist. In such a case, Gabapentin or Pregabalin would help against the pain.","Hi, I'm sorry to hear that you are undergoing the inguinal mesh removal and triple neurectomy. The type of pain and side effects you may experience from the neurectomy depend on the extent of the surgery and the individual patient's response to the procedure.

The procedure may cause pain, discomfort, and/or bleeding, and may take several days to several weeks to heal.

I have had gallbladder out four years ago, I bruise easily, I do get little red skin dots at times, menstrual cycles can be irregular and spleen slightly enlarged.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have gone through your lab reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and they are consistent with the diagnosis made by your doctor.Yellowish tint of the eyes is due to increased bilirubin levels. This is due to the increased red blood cell destruction in the spleen and is commonly a complication of hereditary spherocytosis. It is understandable that you are feeling weak since your body is producing red blood cells at an accelerated rate to compensate for the destruction occurring in the spleen. This is also the reason why your spleen is enlarged. If your condition worsens, your doctor might suggest a splenectomy. This will not cure the condition but will relieve the symptoms since the site of destruction of red blood cells will be removed and your red blood cells will be able to survive for a longer period in the blood. Splenectomy, however, can predispose one to certain bacterial infections and it is important that you receive the appropriate vaccines regularly. You could take folic acid and vitamin B12 supplements since one of your blood tests show macrocytic anemia.

"Hi doctor,Over the last few months, I am experiencing some tingling kind of sensation in muscles on a specific area below the left breast near the rib. I would like to know what it is and the cause for it. I am having that sensation mostly in the evening.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. This tingling sensation can be due to transient nerve compression. This nerve compression can be due to a muscle spasm or due to abnormalities in the thoracic spine. If back pain still persists, then get back to me as you will require a prescription for medication.","Hello, thank you for your question. The tingling sensation you are experiencing in the muscles near the rib below the left breast at night is not uncommon. It is likely due to the pressure of the rib muscles as you sleep. This sensation is known as brachial plexus paresthesia. This is a common condition that occurs when the brachial plexus is compressed by the rib muscles. The brachial plexus is a nerve that runs down the side of the body and is responsible for transmitting signals from the brain to the arm and shoulder muscles. When the brachial plexus is compressed, the signals can be disrupted, causing the sensation of tingling or numbness in the arm and shoulder. The cause of this condition is not known, but it is thought to be related to the pressure of the rib muscles. If you are experiencing any other symptoms or concerns, such as pain or numbness in the arm or shoulder, or if the tingling sensation persists or worsens, it is important to consult a healthcare professional. They can perform a physical examination and take a medical history to determine if there are any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to the tingling sensation. In the meantime, you can try to reduce the pressure on the rib muscles by avoiding activities that cause the pressure, such as lifting heavy objects or bending over. You can also try to sleep on a slightly elevated position, such as a pillow with a rolled-up blanket or pillowcase. If the tingling sensation persists or worsens, it is important to seek medical attention."

"Hello doctor,I would like to go for hair transplantation. So, kindly advice me about which is the best option.","Hello. From your photos (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I can see that you have grade 7 baldness with limited donor hair. But, you have also got small, thinned-out hair in the hair loss area. So my suggestion is as follows. You should understand that the result you can expect is not a head full of hair, but enough hair to cover your baldness. It is a one-day procedure. You can get a 2000-grafts transplant in one session followed by the second session six months later if you want. You will require a review on the third day after the transplant and it can then be followed up online. For more information consult a plastic surgeon online","Hair transplantation is a surgical procedure that involves the transplantation of hair follicles from one part of the body to another. There are two main types of hair transplantation: Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) and Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUTB). FUT is a technique that involves the removal of a small strip of skin and hair from the back or front of the head and then dividing it into individual follicles. The follicles are then transferred to the bald or thinning area of the scalp. FUTB is a newer technique that involves the use of a special instrument that breaks the hair into small follicles and then transferring them to the bald or thinning area of the scalp. The technique is more invasive and requires a longer recovery time. The best option for hair transplantation depends on several factors, such as the size of the bald or thinning area, the density of the hair on the donor site, and the quality of the donor hair. It is recommended that you consult with a hair transplant surgeon who can provide you with a personalized recommendation based on your specific needs and circumstances."

"Respected doctor,My father is suffering from a chronic liver disease. I have attached his case summary with this query. He is in the ICU for the last four days.

So, I want to get a second opinion and want to know, whether there is a way to revive his liver and make it function properly.","Hi. As per the records, he is suffering from stage-3 liver disease, that is an end-stage liver disease. His current problems need to be medically supported. This will result in temporary improvement of his condition. However, issues like infection, blood loss, fluid accumulation in the body, etc., will be frequent from now. The definite treatment ahead is liver transplantation. If you are ready to proceed with evaluation and transplant, then I would suggest considering treatment at a transplant center. Else, medical optimization, which is going on now will be alright. Was an endoscopy done for him? Also blood, abdominal fluid, and urine culture tests? If yes, please send them across.

"Hello doctor,The tooth is sharp and cracked. It is leaving a space in the mouth. What is the treatment?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. How are you doing? I saw the image, but it is not clear (attachment removed to protect patient identity). But, based on how much ever I could appreciate, it seems you have deep caries in your first molar and to some extent nearby second premolar too. The crack or sharpness is due to the loss of tooth structure because of caries (cavity). Kindly take an IOPA (intraoral periapical radiograph) of both the teeth together (in one X-ray itself) and send it to me, along with a clear image of your teeth to help you with a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Do you have or had pain, especially during chewing or sleeping? The treatment plan will vary based on the diagnosis. If the cavity has reached the pulp (blood supply of tooth), it will need a root canal treatment followed by a crown. If it is approximating the pulp, then we will give a temporary filling, wait for a month and if there are no symptoms, then we will change it to a permanent filling (restoration). If it is not even approximating pulp and is in dentin or just enamel (hard structures of teeth), then we will straight away go for permanent restoration (tooth filling). All these will eventually treat your cavity and the sharpness and the gap will go away. Kindly send me a clear picture and the radiograph to help you precisely. Take care. For more information consult a dentist online","Hello, thank you for your question. Based on your description, it seems that your tooth is causing discomfort and leaving a space in your mouth. This could be due to a crack or chip in the tooth. The best course of action would depend on the severity of the crack or chip and the condition of the surrounding teeth. If the crack or chip is not too severe, it may be possible to save the tooth with a filling or crown. However, if the crack or chip is too deep or has caused damage to the root of the tooth, a root canal treatment may be necessary. In either case, it is important to consult a dentist as soon as possible to discuss your options and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, you can try to avoid putting pressure on the tooth and use a cold compress to reduce any discomfort. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask."

"Hello doctor,My son is 10 years old. Since one year, he has been urinating in his pants in school and often arguing with adults and sometimes with other kids. He has once threatened me that he would commit suicide. He tells people he is a \""master manipulator\"" and that there is nothing wrong with him.
