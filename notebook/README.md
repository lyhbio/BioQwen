# BioQwen Model Research Manuscript

## Introduction
This Jupyter Notebook contains the manuscript code for our research on the BioQwen model. The BioQwen model is part of our study in the field of bioinformatics, aimed at addressing the issue that existing biomedical large language models have large parameter sizes and mostly support only QA tasks.

## Contents
The notebook file `BioQwen-manuscript.ipynb` provides a detailed record of our entire process from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. Below is an overview of the main sections of the notebook:

1. **Library Imports and Data Loading**
   - Importing relevant Python libraries
   - Loading the dataset

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing steps
   - Feature extraction and selection

3. **Model Development**
   - Building the BioQwen model
   - Hyperparameter tuning and optimization

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Performance metrics
   - Validation and testing results

5. **Results and Discussion**
   - Analysis of the results
   - Interpretation of the findings

## Running the Code
If you need executable code, please refer to the `script` directory. This notebook file is intended to showcase our research methodology, thought process, and code structure, rather than being a runnable script.

## Usage
